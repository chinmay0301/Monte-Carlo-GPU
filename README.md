# Monte-Carlo-GPU

This repository contains my implementations of the Cross Entropy Optimization Algorithm, for solving the Max-Cut Problem in graph theory, and maximising the implementation of a peak detector function. I compared the performances of the algorithms on a CPU and using CUDA on an Nvidia GPU. Obtained a maximum speed up of 3000 for the peak detector case.
